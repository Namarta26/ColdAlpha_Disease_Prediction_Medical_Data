# ColdAlpha_Disease_Prediction_Medical_Data
# Disease Prediction from Medical Data

## Overview

This project predicts the presence of diseases using structured medical data and machine learning classification techniques. It is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Algorithms Used

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest
* XGBoost (optional)

## Dataset

Medical datasets containing patient information such as age, symptoms, and test results. The target variable indicates disease presence (Yes/No).

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost (optional)

## How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Run the notebook cells sequentially.

## Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Confusion Matrix
